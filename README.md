# Advancing Sexual Health Education for Young African Adults in the Digital Age

A critical 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by all United Nations Member States including those on the African continent is

- ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and reproductive rights  (SDG 5.6). 

- To achieve this, the government of the various African countries need to ensure that by 2030, there is a universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programmes (SDG 3.7).

- The use of enabling technology such as social media could contribute to the empowerment of young African adults to advance their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SDG 5.B).
