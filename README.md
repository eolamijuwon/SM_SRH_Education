## Advancing sexual health education for young African adults in the digital age: Uncovering strategies for successful organic engagement.

We analyzed a corpus of 3,533 sexual and reproductive health messages shared on a public Facebook group by and for young African adults between June 1, 2018, and May 31, 2019, to better understand the unique features associated with higher engagement with sexual health education. Facebook posts were independently classified into thematic categories such as topic, purpose, and tone of communication. The participants generally engage with posts superficially by liking (x̃ = 54; x̄ = 109.28; σ = 159.24) than engage through comments (x̃ = 10; x̄ = 32.03; σ = 62.65) or share (x̃ = 3; x̄ = 11.34; σ = 55.12). Messages with fear [IRR:0.75, 95%CI: 0.66-0.86] or guilt [IRR:0.82, 95%CI: 0.72-0.92] appeals received a significantly lower number of reactions compared to neutral messages. Messages requesting for an opinion [IRR:4.25, 95%CI: 3.57-5.10] had a significantly higher number of comments compared to plain messages. These findings suggest that there is already a window of opportunity to reach young African adults with sexual and reproductive health messages on social media. Our work provides valuable insights and paves the way for the design of effective and engaging sexual and reproductive health information for young African adults on social media.
